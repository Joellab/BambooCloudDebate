# Bamboo Cloud Debate

This project is write by React, aiming to provide a online debate platform. It's still developing.

If you want to test this project, you need:

1. YesApi account -> Fill in to the setupProxy.js
2. Agora Private Key -> Fill in to the compShow.js -> Line 94 -> appId
3. Use our FaceApi to finish the face authorization process

But in most of the cases, you can't run it on your local environment. The aiming of this project is to learn how to code with React and how to bind react and faceapi with face autorization system.

Some of the useful files:
1. utils/faceUtils -> Face detect process
2. pages/faceAuth/faceAuth.js -> Image Clip
